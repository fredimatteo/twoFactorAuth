# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) üõ°Ô∏è

## Introduction
This Python project aims to enhance skills and learn new concepts related to Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) implementations. 
2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the user has on them‚Äîsuch as a physical token.
